1) in rhino, run the GrasshopperFolders command and select Components

2) copy all of the folders in this directory to the Libraries folder that Rhino just opened for you.

3) go through all of the copied folders, and for each file, right click > unblock > apply > ok.  If there is no unblock button available when you right click, you are good to go!
